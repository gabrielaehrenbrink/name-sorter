# Name Sorter

## Overview
The `name_sorter.py` script is designed to read a list of names from a file, validate and sort them by surname and given names, and then write the sorted list to a new file. It ensures that each name has between 1 to 3 given names and a surname before sorting.


## Usage
To use the script, you need to pass the path to the file containing the unsorted list of names as an argument in the command line:
```
python name_sorter.py <path-to-unsorted-names-list.txt>
```
